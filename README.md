## Overview
covid19-data is a powerful and easy to use Python client for getting COVID-19 data (*see sources below
for more information on how data is obtained*)
* Uses a fast method of getting data
    * Does not rely on scraping sites, parsing files, or getting (old) data from a repository, so you do not depend on the 
    repository being updated to get up to date data
* Very fast and responsive
    * The client only gets the data once, and parses it into a search friendly format in the backend, so once the data is 
    loaded ( *~* 1 second ), data for the World or any Country/State can be retrieved instantly
* User friendly and simple to implement into your application
* Very flexible and will return the data in multiple forms (*read documentation section for more info*)
    * Can return a object with the data as attributes
    * Can return a JSON document
* Super simplistic and lightweight and does not rely on any external python packages


## Installing
covid19-data can be installed with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/covid19-data/):
```
$ pip install covid19-data
```
Alternatively, you can grab the latest source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/binarynightowl/covid19_python):
```
$ git clone git://github.com/binarynightowl/covid19_python
$ python setup.py install
```


# Documentation

## Usage
There are two ways of getting data with covid19-data
1. As an object with attributes of COVID data
    * Get the data by name (*note: spacing and capitalization do not matter, EX: `total = covid19_data.dataByName("New 
    York")`, 
    `total = covid19_data.dataByName("newyork")`, and `total = covid19_data.dataByName("NEW YORK")` are all interchangable*)
        ```python
        import covid19_data
    
        # example of how to get data by name
        # .dataByName([string of item to find: any state, country, or total amount (spacing and capitalization do not matter)])
        # object has three useful attributes: .deaths, .cases (.confirmed also works), and .recovered
        
        total = covid19_data.dataByName("Total")    # create an object for our total data
        china = covid19_data.dataByName("China")
        US = covid19_data.dataByName("US")
        new_york = covid19_data.dataByName("NewYork")
        print(total.deaths, china.recovered, US.cases)
        ```
        This should print something similar to:
        ```
        22184 74181 69246
        ```
    * Get the data by abbreviation (*note: spacing and capitalization do not matter, EX: `total = covid19_data.dataByName("New 
    York")`, 
    `total = covid19_data.dataByName("newyork")`, and `total = covid19_data.dataByName("NEW YORK")` are all interchangable*)
        ```python
        import covid19_data        
        
        # example of how to get data by abbreviated name
        # .dataByNameShort([two letter string of item you want to find, can be any state])
        # object has three useful attributes: .deaths, .cases (.confirmed also works), and .recovered
        
        texas = covid19_data.dataByNameShort("TX")    # create an object for our total data
        california = covid19_data.dataByNameShort("CA")
        new_york = covid19_data.dataByNameShort("NY")
        print(texas.cases, california.deaths, new_york.cases)
        ```
        This should print something similar to:
        ```
        1353 67 33033
        ```
2. As a JSON document 
    * Get the json by name (*note: spacing and capitalization do not matter, EX: `total = covid19_data.dataByName("New 
    York")`, 
    `total = covid19_data.dataByName("newyork")`, and `total = covid19_data.dataByName("NEW YORK")` are all interchangable*)
        ```python
        import covid19_data
        
        # example of how to get json by name
        # .jsonByName([string of item you want to find, can be any state, country, or total amount (spacing and capitalization do not matter)])
        # object has three useful attributes: .deaths, .cases (.confirmed also works), and .recovered
        
        total = covid19_data.jsonByName("Total")    # create an object for our total data
        china = covid19_data.jsonByName("China")
        US = covid19_data.jsonByName("US")
        new_york = covid19_data.jsonByName("NewYork")
        print(total, china, US, new_york)
        ```
        This should print something similar to:
        ```
        {'Confirmed': 492603, 'Deaths': 22184, 'Recovered': 119918}
        {'Confirmed': 81782, 'Deaths': 3291, 'Recovered': 74181, 'Active': 4310}
        {'Confirmed': 69246, 'Deaths': 1046, 'Recovered': 619, 'Active': 0}
        {'Confirmed': 33033, 'Deaths': 366, 'Recovered': 0, 'Active': 0}
        ```
    * Get the json by abbreviation (*note: spacing and capitalization do not matter, EX: `total = covid19_data.dataByName("New 
    York")`, 
    `total = covid19_data.dataByName("newyork")`, and `total = covid19_data.dataByName("NEW YORK")` are all interchangable*)
        ```python
        import covid19_data
        
        # example of how to get json by abbreviated name
        # .jsonByNameShort([two letter string of item you want to find, can be any state])
        # object has three useful attributes: .deaths, .cases (.confirmed also works), and .recovered
        
        texas = covid19_data.jsonByNameShort("TX")    # create an object for our total data
        california = covid19_data.jsonByNameShort("CA")
        new_york = covid19_data.jsonByNameShort("NY")
        print(texas, california, new_york)
        ```
        This should print something similar to:
        ```
        {'Confirmed': 1353, 'Deaths': 17, 'Recovered': 0, 'Active': 0}
        {'Confirmed': 3172, 'Deaths': 67, 'Recovered': 0, 'Active': 0}
        {'Confirmed': 33033, 'Deaths': 366, 'Recovered': 0, 'Active': 0}
        ```
