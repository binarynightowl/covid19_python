covid19-data is a powerful and easy to use Python client for getting COVID-19 data (*see sources below
for more information on how data is obtained*)
* Uses a faster method of getting data than similar packages
    * Does not rely on scraping sites, parsing files, or getting (old) data from a repository, so you do not depend on the 
    repository being updated to get up to date data
* Very fast and responsive
    * The client only gets the data once, and parses it into a search friendly format in the backend, so once the data is 
    loaded ( *~* 1 second ), data for the World or any Country/State can be retrieved instantly
* User friendly and simple to implement into your application
